These are my solutions to Project Euler Problems.

Few of them are commented in anyway, but I'll be updating that as code reading practice maybe.

Used this to learn ruby, and I do a lot weird because i never read any books on it. I use some parts of ruby very nicely, 
but at the same time use crap like for loops.

Also, the O time isn't the best for all of them. Some problems need to be left for 5-10 minutes for the solution
